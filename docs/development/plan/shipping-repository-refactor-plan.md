# Shipping Repository Refactor - Development Plan

## Overview
Refactor the `RajaOngkirClient` from the service layer to the repository layer to align with clean architecture principles and prepare for enhanced caching capabilities.

**Important Note**: Since this service is not yet released, we can ignore backward compatibility concerns and implement a cleaner, more direct approach.

## Current State Analysis

### Issues Identified
1. **Architectural Violation**: `RajaOngkirClient` performs data access operations but resides in service layer
2. **Tight Coupling**: Service directly depends on external API client implementation
3. **Limited Extensibility**: Difficult to add caching or switch to alternative shipping providers
4. **Testing Complexity**: Mixed concerns make unit testing more complex

### Current Dependencies
```
Handler -> Service -> RajaOngkirClient -> External API
```

### Target Architecture
```
Handler -> Service -> ShippingRepository (Interface) -> RajaOngkirRepository (Implementation) -> External API
```

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Repository Layer Creation (1-2 days)
**Objective**: Create repository layer and move client logic directly

#### Tasks:
- Create `internal/repository/shipping.go` interface
- Create `internal/repository/rajaongkir/` directory structure  
- Move `RajaOngkirClient` logic to `RajaOngkirShippingRepository`
- Update dependency injection to use repository
- Ensure configuration and security patterns are maintained

#### Success Criteria:
- Repository layer implemented with moved client logic
- All security configurations (API keys, timeouts) properly handled
- Clean interface separation achieved

### Phase 2: Service Layer Refactoring (1-2 days)  
**Objective**: Update service layer to use repository interface

#### Tasks:
- Update `ShippingService` to depend on `ShippingRepository` interface
- Refactor service initialization to inject repository dependency
- Update error handling and response transformation logic
- Remove old client dependencies from service layer

#### Success Criteria:
- Service layer uses repository interface exclusively
- Clean separation of business logic from data access
- All service methods properly integrated

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation (2-3 days)
**Objective**: Ensure >85% test coverage with proper separation of concerns

#### Tasks:
- Create comprehensive repository layer unit tests
- Update service layer tests to use repository mocks
- Implement integration tests for full stack
- Update mock generation and test utilities
- Performance testing for external API calls

#### Success Criteria:
- Test coverage remains above 85%
- Repository tests cover all API scenarios and error cases
- Service tests focus on business logic with mocked dependencies
- Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Documentation (1 day)
**Objective**: Remove old code and finalize implementation

#### Tasks:
- Remove obsolete `RajaOngkirClient` from service layer
- Clean up unused interfaces and imports
- Update documentation and code comments
- Finalize architecture for future enhancements

#### Success Criteria:
- No dead code remains
- Clean separation between layers
- Documentation reflects new architecture
- Ready for future caching implementation

## Risk Assessment

### Medium Risk
1. **External API Integration Issues**: Changes to HTTP client configuration could affect API calls
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive integration testing, thorough configuration validation
   
2. **Test Coverage Degradation**: Refactoring might reduce test coverage below 85%
   - **Mitigation**: Implement tests incrementally, monitor coverage metrics continuously

### Low Risk  
3. **Performance Impact**: Additional abstraction layer might impact response times
   - **Mitigation**: Benchmark testing, performance monitoring

4. **Configuration Migration**: API keys and timeout settings might need adjustment
   - **Mitigation**: Configuration validation, extensive testing in staging environment

### Low Risk
5. **Import Path Changes**: Moving files might require import updates
   - **Mitigation**: Update import paths systematically, use IDE refactoring tools

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management
- Ensure API keys remain properly injected through configuration
- Validate that repository layer doesn't expose sensitive data in logs
- Maintain proper error handling to prevent information leakage

### HTTP Client Security
- Preserve existing timeout configurations
- Ensure TLS settings are maintained
- Validate input sanitization for external API calls

### Error Handling
- Implement proper error wrapping to avoid exposing internal details
- Maintain audit logging for external API calls
- Ensure graceful degradation for API failures

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality Standards
- Maintain clean architecture principles
- Follow existing code style and naming conventions
- Ensure proper dependency injection patterns
- Implement comprehensive error handling

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all repository methods
- Service layer tests with mocked dependencies  
- Integration tests for complete user flows
- Performance tests for external API interactions
- Security tests for configuration and error handling

### Performance Benchmarks
- API response times should remain stable (within 5ms variance)
- Memory usage should remain stable
- External API call patterns should be optimized

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >85% across all modified components
- **Performance**: API response times remain stable
- **Architecture**: Clean separation between service and repository layers
- **Security**: No new security vulnerabilities introduced

### Business Metrics
- **Zero Downtime**: No service interruptions during deployment
- **Feature Readiness**: Architecture prepared for caching implementation
- **Code Quality**: Improved maintainability and extensibility

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Phase 1: Repository Creation | 1-2 days | Configuration review |
| Phase 2: Service Refactoring | 1-2 days | Phase 1 complete |
| Phase 3: Testing and Validation | 2-3 days | Phases 1-2 complete |
| Phase 4: Cleanup and Documentation | 1 day | All previous phases |
| **Total** | **5-8 days** | |

## Simplified Implementation Strategy

Since backward compatibility is not required:

1. **Direct Migration**: Move client logic directly to repository layer without maintaining dual interfaces
2. **Clean Removal**: Remove old client code immediately after migration
3. **Simplified Testing**: Focus on new architecture without testing compatibility layers
4. **Faster Timeline**: Reduced complexity allows for faster implementation

## Next Steps After Completion

1. **Caching Implementation**: Add Redis/in-memory caching to repository layer
2. **Multiple Provider Support**: Abstract interface to support additional shipping APIs
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement connection pooling and request batching
4. **Monitoring Enhancement**: Add detailed metrics and observability
