}
```

## Documentation Updates

### Architecture Documentation
```markdown
# Updated Architecture Section

## Shipping Module Architecture

The shipping module follows clean architecture principles with clear separation between layers:

### Repository Layer
- **Interface**: `internal/repository/shipping.go`
- **Implementation**: `internal/repository/rajaongkir/client.go`
- **Responsibility**: Data access from external shipping APIs

### Service Layer  
- **Interface**: `internal/service/shipping.go`
- **Implementation**: `internal/service/shipping/impl.go`
- **Responsibility**: Business logic and data transformation

### Handler Layer
- **Implementation**: `internal/handler/shipping/shipping.go`
- **Responsibility**: HTTP request/response handling

### Dependencies Flow
```
Handler → Service Interface → Repository Interface → External API
```

### Benefits of Current Architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy testing with dependency injection
- Extensible for multiple shipping providers
- Prepared for caching implementation
```

### API Documentation Updates
```markdown
# Shipping API Implementation Notes

## Architecture
The shipping endpoints are backed by a clean architecture implementation:

- **Repository Pattern**: External API calls are abstracted behind repository interfaces
- **Dependency Injection**: All dependencies are properly injected at application startup
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- **Caching Ready**: Architecture supports future caching implementation

## Performance Characteristics
- **Response Times**: Typically 100-500ms depending on external API
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects external API rate limits
- **Timeout Handling**: 30-second timeout for external API calls
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of external API failures
```

### Migration Guide
```markdown
# Shipping Repository Refactor - Migration Guide

## Overview
This document provides guidance for similar repository refactoring in other modules.

## Process
1. **Create Repository Interface** - Define data access contract
2. **Implement Repository** - Move data access logic to repository layer
3. **Update Service Layer** - Use repository interface instead of direct clients
4. **Update Dependency Injection** - Wire new dependencies
5. **Update Tests** - Create repository tests and update service tests
6. **Clean Up** - Remove legacy code and update documentation

## Best Practices
- Always implement repository interface first
- Maintain test coverage throughout refactoring
- Use dependency injection for all external dependencies
- Separate business logic from data access logic
- Document architectural decisions

## Common Pitfalls
- Breaking existing service interfaces
- Dropping test coverage below thresholds
- Mixing business logic with data access
- Incomplete dependency injection
```

### Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
```markdown
# ADR-001: Move RajaOngkir Client to Repository Layer

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The `RajaOngkirClient` was originally placed in the service layer, violating clean architecture principles by mixing business logic with data access concerns.

## Decision
Move the `RajaOngkirClient` to the repository layer and create proper abstractions.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clean separation of concerns
- Improved testability
- Better preparation for caching
- Easier to swap shipping providers
- Follows established patterns in codebase

### Negative
- Temporary complexity during migration
- Additional abstraction layer
- More files to maintain

## Implementation
- Repository interface: `internal/repository/shipping.go`
- Implementation: `internal/repository/rajaongkir/client.go`
- Service updated to use repository interface
- Complete test coverage maintained

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Keep in service layer** - Rejected due to architecture violations
2. **Create separate HTTP client package** - Rejected as it doesn't solve separation of concerns
3. **Move to external package** - Rejected as it complicates dependency management

## Post-Cleanup Validation

### Architecture Validation
```go
func TestArchitecture_CleanArchitecturePrinciples(t *testing.T) {
    // Verify service layer doesn't import repository implementations
    // Verify repository layer doesn't import service layer
    // Verify handler layer only imports service interfaces
}

func TestDependencies_NoCircularDependencies(t *testing.T) {
    // Verify no circular dependencies exist
    // Check import graph is acyclic
}
```

### Documentation Tests
```go
func TestDocumentation_CodeExamplesCompile(t *testing.T) {
    // Extract code examples from documentation
    // Verify they compile and run correctly
}
```

## Future Considerations

### Caching Implementation
- Repository layer is now ready for caching
- Service layer doesn't need changes for caching
- Handler layer remains unaffected

### Multiple Provider Support
- Repository interface can support multiple implementations
- Service layer can choose providers based on business logic
- Configuration can select active providers

### Monitoring and Observability
- Repository layer can easily add metrics
- Service layer can add business metrics
- Clear separation enables focused monitoring
